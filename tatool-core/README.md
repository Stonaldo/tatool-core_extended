Tatool Core 1.3.2 Source code
========================

This is the Tatool-Core 1.3.2 package source code. There are occasions where I have 
wanted to make changes to Tatools default behaviour, sometimes it was easily 
achievable through extending one of tatools classes and writing my own with the 
modified behaviours. However on occasion it is tricky and is much easier to just add 
a method or two to one of the source classes.

By compiling this into a JAR and then replacing the tatool-core 1.3.2 JAR that 
lives in your repository with the newly compiled one you can then make use of 
the additional functionality.
